## **1 Introduction**

The Grocery List Manager ® is an Android application for managing your grocery lists both in planning and execution. Throughout the week, keep track of your grocery list needs by quickly adding items to your grocery list. When at the grocery store, check off your items as you add them to your cart to remember what is left to buy.

## **2 Process Description**

The Grocery List Manager ® application is being completed in three phases: Design, Development, and Testing. Using an Agile methodology, these phases will be overlapping, such that you do not need to exit Design prior to beginning Development; likewise Development does not need to conclude prior to starting Testing. At any one time, all three activities might be ongoing.
